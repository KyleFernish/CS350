•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
o	The project was to create an embedded system that was able to read the current temperature, set a temperature for a thermostat to maintain, adjust the set temperature at single degree increments, indicate whether or not the heat was being turned on with an LED, and display the information that would be sent to a server via Wi-Fi.
•	What did you do particularly well?
o	In this project I was able to take a simple look at the different steps that needed to be solved and create a simple framework to follow along with for some of the more complicated tasks.
•	Where could you improve?
o	I have a few areas where I can improve, but I would say the single thing that would help me more than anything else would be to expand my knowledge base for different ways to solve problems.  Right now, I feel like I narrow my focus to only attempting to solve the problem with the criteria we’ve learned in the course, and forget or ignore previous ways I’ve learned to solve similar problems.
•	What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
o	The tools I’m adding to my support network after this project is the ability to ask intelligent questions that are pointed to the specific issues, I’m facing with a problem set.  
o	I have not found a lot of different resources to use beyond websites that have an owner’s manual layout of sorts that walk users through basic set ups and can be scaled outwards to more advanced ways.
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
o	The best skill I was able to refine was taking functions from previous programs and manipulating them to the current program I’m working on.
•	How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
o	This project was made maintainable by doing incremental programming, and building the project step by step as I added things.
o	The project was made readable by using common sense commenting for each task, or step that needed to be laid out.
o	The program was made adaptable by using simple commenting so that anyone who looked at the project could see how different functions were created and their intent.
